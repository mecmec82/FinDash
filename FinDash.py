        *   **1Yr Sales Growth:** The percentage increase in a company's revenue over the past 12 months (latest fiscal year vs. previous fiscal year). Higher is generally better for growth.
        *   **5Yr Sales Growth:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of a company's revenue over the past five fiscal years. Indicates consistent long-term growth. Requires 5 years of historical revenue data.
        *   **Debt to Equity:** A ratio indicating the proportion of equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. Lower is generally better (less reliance on debt), but varies significantly by industry (e.g., financial institutions often have higher D/E). An "Inf" value means total equity is zero or negative.
        *   **PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio):** A stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings per share (EPS).
            *   **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE ON PEG RATIO:** This metric **cannot be reliably calculated using `yfinance`** because it fundamentally requires *future* earnings per share (EPS) growth estimates (typically a 5-year forecasted growth from analysts), which `yfinance` does not provide. Therefore, it will always show "N/A" for live fetched companies in this application.
        *   **Trailing P/E (Price/Earnings Ratio):** The stock's current share price divided by its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months. This is included here as a readily available fundamental valuation metric.
