# --- Mock Data ---
# In a real application, you would replace this with data fetched from a financial API.
# Common free APIs include:
# - yfinance (via `pip install yfinance`): Good for basic stock prices, some income/balance sheet.
#   You'd need to calculate sales growth yourself from annual revenue.
# - Alpha Vantage (needs API key): Offers various financial data.
# - Financial Modeling Prep (FMP - needs API key): Offers detailed financials, some ratios.
#
# PEG ratio is particularly tricky to get for free as it requires future EPS growth estimates.
# You might need to calculate it yourself: PEG = (P/E Ratio) / (Annual EPS Growth Rate)
# where EPS Growth Rate is often analyst consensus for next 5 years.

    *   **1Yr Sales Growth:** The percentage increase in a company's revenue over the past 12 months. Higher is generally better for growth.
    *   **5Yr Sales Growth:** The average annual percentage increase in a company's revenue over the past five years. Indicates consistent long-term growth.
    *   **Debt to Equity:** A ratio indicating the proportion of equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. Lower is generally better (less reliance on debt), but varies by industry.
    *   **PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio):** A stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings per share (EPS). A PEG ratio of 1.0 is often considered fair value, while lower values (e.g., < 1) may indicate undervalued stocks and higher values (e.g., > 2) may suggest overvalued stocks relative to their growth.
