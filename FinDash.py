        *   **1Yr Sales Growth:** The percentage increase in a company's revenue over the past 12 months. Higher is generally better for growth.
        *   **5Yr Sales Growth:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of a company's revenue over the past five years. Indicates consistent long-term growth.
        *   **Debt to Equity:** A ratio indicating the proportion of equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. Lower is generally better (less reliance on debt), but varies significantly by industry (e.g., banks often have higher D/E).
        *   **PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio):** A stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings per share (EPS).
            *   **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE ON PEG RATIO:** This metric **cannot be reliably calculated using `yfinance`** because it requires *future* earnings per share (EPS) growth estimates (typically 5-year forecasted growth from analysts), which `yfinance` does not provide. It will show "N/A" for fetched companies.
        *   **Trailing P/E (Price/Earnings Ratio):** The stock's current share price divided by its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months. Included here as a fundamental valuation metric, as PEG is unavailable.
